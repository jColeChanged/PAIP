The thing most interesting about this chapter is that it really shows that to create a complex program which can raelly impress people you don't need the most complicated solution. You don't need a strong AI to have an AI which can be useful. You can just fake it. Another example of this which seems releveant to me was a time where I saw someone faking image recognition. They had a database of pictures which had been tagged with metadata about where a finger in an image was pointing. Through this metadata they were able to choose pictures which were pointing at the cursor of someone useing the site. It looked like they were figuring it out through the picture, because they made processing take a while. Really though they were just abusing the metadata. It was closer to seeing which finger ray metadata had the ray closest to the cursor.
