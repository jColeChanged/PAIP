;; Eliza was a chat bot built in the 1960s. It used pattern matching to trick
;; those who interacted with it into thinking that it had some measure of
;; intelligence. According to Peter Norvig in PAIP, Eliza was not a serious
;; an attempt at a serious AI. Knowing how the program works helps to explain
;; what he means by that.

;; The Eliza chat bot works by first reading input, then finding a pattern which
;; matches the input. Using the pattern as a guide the bot proceeds to transform
;; the input into a response which is then printed.


;; Demonstrates the similarity between the common lisp function equal and the
;; code used for pattern matching.

;; So far the Eliza program doesn't seem to be doing anything complicated or

;; can also take a bit of captured text and return it. To me, it seems very
;; similar to a glorified regular expression.

;; In fact, as I look at what Norvig is having me write out, I notice that
;; it reminds me a lot of a regular expression matching program.
