6.1: Changing the program to use the abbrev facilities did make thigns more readable. However, when writing code meant to be read by someone else I believe it could be a very dangerous approach. It wouldn't be good for someone to be expecting a data structure matching the simplified form only to discover the more complicated function upon deep inspection. Moreover, to an end user of the system it would probably be best to hide the details of the implementation still further. So I guess there is a bit of dialect tension here. A user would want the implementation to be hidden from him, but a programmer looking at the code wants the implementation to be clearly seen.
