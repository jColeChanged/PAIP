When I programmed in Python I was given the illusion that there is only one way to solve a problem. Lisp doesn't try to create this illusion. In Lisp your given two options right from the outset: right your program in the way that maps to the code or express the problem in the way which best maps to the problem domain. This is an option, because Lisp makes it very easy to write a program which interprets said expression.
