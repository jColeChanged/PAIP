PP* would mean PP zero or more times. This is known as Kleen star notation after the mathemtician Stephen Cole Kleene. PP+ is similar. It is called Kleen plus notation and means PP one or more times. Norvig uses these notations to express how his functions will behave, but he isn't the only one. I have a feeling that this notation is what gave rise to the notation used in regular expressions.
